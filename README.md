These changes pertained to the total number of students, number of students counted at Thomas High School, passing percentage for reading scores, the overall passing percentage for both math and reading at Thomas High School. The variation in total students resulted from a decrease in the count of overall students and the total student count at Thomas High School. This in turn flows down to affect the average scores and percentages. However, the removal of data concerning Thomas High School’s 9th graders caused a drastic shift in THS’s individual percentages. As a result the passing reading percentage at Thomas declined from 97.30% to 69.66% and the overall passing percentage for both math and reading at THS dropped from 90.94% to 65.07%. This significant decrease has moved Thomas High school down the list for the top schools.
